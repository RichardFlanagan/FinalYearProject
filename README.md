# FinalYearProject
My final year thesis: Analysis and Visualisation of Twitter Data for Growth Hacking using the Raspberry Pi 

## Abstract

Many start-ups and technology companies have started to adopt a new form of
marketing strategy dubbed ‘Growth Hacking’. Growth hacking takes advantage of
modern internet technologies to achieve a self-perpetuating marketing campaign as
quickly and inexpensively as possible. Such a campaign can be achieved in Twitter
though the use of well-crafted and well-timed tweets targeted at the most responsive
audience.

This projects main output will be an online data analysis service run entirely on a
Raspberry Pi, marketed at this new generation of Growth Hackers. Users will be able
to view the impact of their marketing strategy, and make changes to maximise impact.
It will also explore the suitability of the inexpensive Pi in the field of data analysis and
growth hacking.

This service is targeted towards users developing or updating their marketing strategy.
Locations, times, and volume of audience participation is important to show to the
marketer. An ability to access data from anywhere in the world, at any time, as well as
filtering options to reduce your area of interest both make sense for a market to have.
These feature drove the development of my product, leading to design choices like
providing this software as an online service.

Results tend to show that the Pi is capable of small levels of data analysis. Large
datasets prove too much for this machine. The analysis-as-a-service model used by
the service requires fast response times which the Pi cannot provide. However, given
powerful server hardware, this service is most definitely a viable and marketable
product, one that could be used by marketing teams worldwide.
